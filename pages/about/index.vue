            Frostor provides a solution for users across chains to upload
            content to the Arweave blockweave, utilizing their native wallets
            and identities. Facilitating cross-chain data storage and identity
            coherence in the blockchain ecosystem.

            Core Functionality
          </p>
          <p>
            Frostor acts as a bridge facilitating direct interactions between
            different blockchain networks and Arweave. It allows for the use of
            existing blockchain wallet identities to manage uploads, ensuring
            that contributions are consistently attributed to the correct source
            across platforms. This approach supports a more unified and
            traceable record of digital assets and interactions.

            Maintaining a singular identity for users across multiple
            blockchains, improving the attribution of digital content and
            enhancing the provenance of digital assets. Frostor leverages the
            inherent immutability and permanence of blockchain technology to
            ensure that each piece of content is verifiably linked to its
            creator, thereby addressing common concerns around digital ownership
            and copyright in the decentralized space.
